About Employee Management System Project
Moving on, this employee management system project in PHP CodeIgniter focuses mainly on dealing with employee’s information such as their departments, salaries, and leaves. Also, the system displays all the available employee details such as name, contact details, photos, and more. In addition, the system allows managing departments too by just entering its name. This project is divided into two categories: Admin Panel and Employee Panel. In an overview of this web application, the admin has access to everything and manages them easily. The admin has the right to manage the salary for each employee. For this, an admin has to first select an available department and then select the department’s employee. Here, he/she has to enter salary information such as basic salary, and allowances. After this, the system alerts respective employees regarding their salaries.

Not just it, the admin can also view each salary transaction’s invoice and generate a PDF copy from the salary history section. Additionally, the admin can manage each employee’s leave request. This section contains each employee’s name with leave dates, apply date, reason with some description, and current status to declare whether it’s pending, approved, or rejected. After managing the employee’s leave, the employee can view their status from their own employee panel. A different thing out here is that, after adding staff’s record, the system does not ask to create any login credentials, but instead it uses the staff’s email and phone number as their login credentials. Besides, the system shows total paid salaries, numbers of staff, and other information on the admin’s dashboard.
